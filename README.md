# stock-news
### I am a retail investor and i track my investment using google spreadsheet but i dont have much time to explore the latest news about the companies i have invested in
### so to solve this problem i created this script using python which scrapes latest stock news about the companies i have invested in and fetch it directly to my google spreadsheet using google sheets api.
