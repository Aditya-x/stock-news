# stock-news
#### I am an amateur investor and I track my investment using a google spreadsheet but I don't have much time to explore the latest news about the companies I have invested in,  so to solve this problem I created this script using python which scrapes the latest market news about the companies I have invested in and fetches it directly to my google spreadsheet using google sheets API.
#### I have deployed this script via Heroku the script updates news every 24 hours.
